## Features

- Adaptive sleep on smooth DDC transitions

## Fixes

- Ensure Shortcuts keep working after automatic and manual app restarts
    - *Looks like using `exec` to restart the app invalidates the XPC connections that Shortcuts opens, who knew..*

## Improvements

- Ensure location coordinates update often enough
- Preserve privacy better by using *reduced location data* with a maximum of *city level accuracy*
    - *The coordinates never leave the computer, this is just to preserve privacy in case of a rogue program or app*
