## Improvements

* Show tooltips with the reason why a specific Mode is disabled when hovering on it
* Allow controlling monitor with the cursor on it when **Send Keys To All Monitors** is unchecked
* Add useful reset buttons in the gear icon menu
    * **Reset Network Control** for when the network controls aren't activated automatically because the system mDNS browser is stuck
    * **Reset DDC** for when DDC is deemed unresponsive because the system has reported the monitor as active when it was in fact inactive

## Fixes

* Fix crashes because of gamma locking
* More UI accesses moved to Main Thread
