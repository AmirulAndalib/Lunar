## Improvements

* Show slider values on the knob
* Improve slider contrast
* Add glass material to QuickActions
* Detect HDMI port properly on the M1 Pro and M1 Max
    * This will disable DDC automatically for that port as there's still no way to send DDC commands through it

## Fixes

* Hide second background of QuickActions when Reduce Transparency is active
* Make sure to re-enable adaptive brightness on built-in after switching from Manual to other modes while in an App Preset
