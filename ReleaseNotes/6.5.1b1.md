## Improvements

- Add hidden settings `autoRestartOnCrash` and `autoRestartOnHang` to control automatic restarts
- Add hidden setting `jitterBrightnessOnWake` for automatically moving brightness up/down 1% on wake
    - This is useful for LG UltraFine displays which wake up with the wrong brightness and need a manual nudge to get back to the correct brightness

## Fixes

- Fix opening Night Shift settings when f.lux is detected on macOS 13+
- Fix app hanging when initializing Location Services in some cases
- Fix crashes caused by using buttons on drawing tablets
