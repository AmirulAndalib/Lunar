## PWM flicker minimization

By combining hardware and software dimming at specific thresholds, Lunar can help people sensitive to PWM flickering.

*The below video shows how you can use the [Halide](https://halide.cam/) iOS app to find the lowest brightness where flickering starts to appear.*

#### How to use it

For 2021 Apple Silicon MacBooks, adjust the **Min Brightness** to `38` in [Display Settings](https://app.lunar.fyi/display/builtin) to get advantage of this.

Lunar will then use [Sub-zero Dimming](https://lunar.fyi/#subzero) below that value, which keeps the LED voltage steady while blocking light using the LCD.

For external monitors and other screens, play with the **Min Brightness** setting until you find the threshold under which PWM flicker becomes noticeable.

Then set the minimum brightness to the lowest value that doesn't cause flicker.

## Improvements

* Added `sidecar` option to `lunar toggle-connection` CLI command

## Fixes

* Fix `Sub-zero Dimming` being overridden by the system adaptive brightness
* Fix contrast jumping from max to min when going to/from Sub-zero Dimming
* Fix flashes and sudden transitions when going in and out of `Sub-zero Dimming`
