## PWM flicker minimization

By combining hardware and software dimming at specific thresholds, Lunar can help people sensitive to PWM flickering.

For the Apple Silicon MacBooks adjust the **Min Brightness** to `38` in [Display Settings](https://app.lunar.fyi/display/builtin) to get advantage of this.

For other screens, play with the **Min Brightness** setting until you find the threshold under which PWM flicker becomes noticeable. Then set the min brightness to the lowest value that doesn't cause flicker.

Here's a thread that explains how to better find the flicker limit: https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/macbook-pro-14-m2pro-pwm-solution.2386836/?post=32099271#post-32099271

Limiting the min brightness to the range which does not cause PWM flicker will allow Lunar to lower LED voltage in that range, while keeping voltage steady and only blocking light through the liquid crystals below that range.

## Improvements

* Added `sidecar` option to `lunar toggle-connection` CLI command

## Fixes

* Fix `Sub-zero Dimming` being overridden by the system adaptive brightness
* Fix contrast jumping from max to min when going to/from Sub-zero Dimming
* Fix flashes and sudden transitions when going in and out of `Sub-zero Dimming`
