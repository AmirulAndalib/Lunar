## Features

* **DDC support for M1 Macs** (beta)
    * Only possible because of the great advice and example code from [Zhuowei Zhang](https://github.com/zhuowei) and the amazing work of [Davide Guerri](https://github.com/dguerri) and [Tao J](https://github.com/tao-j)
    * **Mac Mini HDMI still not working**: [Mac Mini Github issue](https://github.com/alin23/Lunar/issues/125)
+ Add a way to set default gamma values when using Hardware/Native/Network controls

## Improvements

* Add "Hide yellow dot" checkbox in Advanced settings
* Reset DDC write/read faults when a successful read is detected to avoid the incorrect marking of monitors as *Non-reponsive DDC*

## Fixes

* Fix license not being activated without an app restart
* Fix Location Mode not fetching correct sunrise/sunset/noon when close to midnight
* Don't reset ColorSync settings and hopefully respect calibration profiles in Gamma mode
* Fix brightness flickering caused by Gamma controls kicking in faster than DDC/CoreDisplay/Network by adding a 5 second delay to the Gamma setter after:
    * App launch
    * System startup
    * Login 
    * Wake from standby
    * Display connection/reconnection
