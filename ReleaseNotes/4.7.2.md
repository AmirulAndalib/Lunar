## Improvements

* Add SPI as lib dependency for sensor firmware to avoid compilation errors in the future
* Improve Network Control monitor matching in multi-monitor cases
* Quit older instances if a user launches Lunar while it is already running
* Always show Network Control prompt on the main monitor
* Check if new value is different from old value when listening for settings changes to avoid duplicating events

## Fixes

* Don't check for updates on launch to avoid annoying people who don't like updates as much as I do
* Fix typo which caused the monitor serial to be wrongly compared to the product ID when matching monitors
* Allow CLI to set properties that don't need an available control
