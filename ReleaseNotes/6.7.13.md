## Features

- Allow HDR monitors to use the superior **Apple Native** brightness control instead of **DDC** on macOS Sequoia

## Fixes

- Ignore displays named **"Unknown Display"** which may appear when the monitor's connection is not ready for DDC

## Improvements

- Ensure Software Dimming does dim the screen instead of whiten it when Invert Colors is enabled in Accessibility settings
    - *This will force a white Overlay instead of Gamma dimming since gamma tables can't be inverted in a precise enough way*
- Make sure menu does not end up behind the menu bar when that is set to autohide
