### Improvements

* Show when brightness or contrast is locked
* Make it clear that DDC reading is experimental and should not be used unless really needed

* Detect manual changes in XDR state and honor them in the Auto XDR logic

## Fixes

* UI fixes in preparation for macOS Ventura
* Known issues:
    * Scrolling over the slider feels clunkier and less fluid in macOS 13, hoping this is an OS bug that will get addressed in next beta
    * Some animations feel slower
