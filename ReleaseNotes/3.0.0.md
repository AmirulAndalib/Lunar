## Features
- Add support for changing monitor volume and mute state
- Show native OSD when changing monitor brightness, contrast and volume
- Implement listeners for media keys
    * Lunar will ask for accessibility permissions to enable this functionality
    * Instructions: 
        * Press keyboard brightness keys while the cursor is on an external monitor to change the brightness on that monitor 
        * Press Control + keyboard brightness keys to adjust contrast 
        * Press keyboard volume/mute keys while the audio output is set to the monitor audio device to adjust volume/mute
        * In multi-monitor setups, Lunar can't detect which monitor audio device is selected so it will change the volume of the display that the cursor is on
- Many thanks to Hongfeng Xu (@Mic238) for helping me with extensive testing on these features!


## Improvements

- Detect non-responsive monitors and show that in the Quick Actions popover
- Automatic detection of GPU for adaptive DDC reply delay
    - This should minimize kernel panics and system freezes when reading values from the monitor
- Add special brightness implementation for **LED Cinema** monitors 

## Fixes
- Fixed a typo that was preventing smooth transition to be disabled for contrast
