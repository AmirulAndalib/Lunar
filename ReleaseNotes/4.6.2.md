## Features

* **Tutorial completed for DIY Wireless Ambient Light Sensor:** [https://lunar.fyi/sensor](https://lunar.fyi/sensor)
* Add option to apply volume 0 on pressing mute in **Advanced** settings
    * Some monitors don't accept the mute DDC control so this could be useful
* Curve factors separated by display and mode
    * The curve factors are now found in the gear icon menu and are stored on a per-monitor and per-mode basis
    * If you set some curve factors while Lunar is in Sync Mode and then change to Location Mode for example, there will be different curve factor values
    
## Improvements

* Re-apply brightness and contrast when the display control changes

## Fixes

* Correctly turn on/off the refresh values thread when checking/unchecking "Refresh values from monitor settings"
* Turn on Sync Mode correctly on Lunar launch
