## Licensing model

**Some clarifications are needed after the change:** 

* I don't have any plans on releasing a major version this year
* If for some reason I have to do that, everyone who paid for the 1-year of free updates before the change will receive the update for free if it's within their update period

This was not a sudden change to rip users off as some like to accuse. I liked the old model, and money-wise I would have probably had a more sustainable income with the 1-year model. If Apple breaks DDC yet again, the multi-month-long effort I'll have to put in to fix that won't warrant a major release as it would feel more like a bug fix for end users, while it would feel more like writing a whole new app for me.

But for months people kept asking for this major version model, mostly because it feels less like a subscription. This is just a compromise so I can move on and focus on building Lunar instead of constantly answering questions about how Lunar Pro is or isn't a subscription.

## Improvements

* Show that XDR needs Pro license instead of doing nothing
* Choose alpha upgrades over beta ones when the alpha channel is used
* Move DDC reads outside the main thread
* Improve brightness reponsiveness check
* Collect average DDC read/write time for features that depend on DDC timing (e.g. smooth transitions, refreshing values from monitor memory etc.)
* Multi-user Fast Switching support
    * Retry display list reconciliation when the system provides invalid IDs
    * Disable Sync Mode if polling seconds is 0 and brightness observer fails to start
    * Observe log in/out events and stop calling screen wake listener if logged out
    * Pause HDR workaround while logged out
    * Pause Lunar if the user switches to another user

## Fixes

* Fix overall keyboard latency
* Pause some functions when switching users or going to standby
    * Light sensor detection
    * CLI server
    * Color and Gamma reader
    * Brightness observer
* Fix app info not hiding on first launch
* Fix crash on fetching the refresh rate string for the resolution dropdown
