## Features

- Re-organize advanced settings
- Isolate **App Info** UI into its own little window and hide it by default on first launch

## Improvements

- Ask about **Full Range XDR** at onboarding and default to it for new users
- Make HDR redraw dot less visible when using XDR Brightness
- Allow disabling "bad display" detection through the `ignoreDisplaysWithMissingMetadata` setting:

```sh
defaults write fyi.lunar.Lunar ignoreDisplaysWithMissingMetadata false
```

Only to be used in cases where:

- BlackOut wrongly reconnects the screen 5-10 seconds after disconnecting it
- screen remains black after disabling BlackOut

## Fixes

- Adapt software dimming dynamically if **Invert Colors** is used often while Lunar is running *(previously it needed an app restart when changing the Invert Colors setting)*
- Fix **Full Range XDR** for `macOS Sequoia beta 3`
- Fix re-applying the wrong stored brightness after wake
