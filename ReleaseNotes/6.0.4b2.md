#### Fully Automated

This makes Clock Mode override any manual adjustments done by the user.

It also makes it re-apply the brightness of the previous schedule after standby/wake or after a screen reconnection.

#### User Controlled

This makes Clock Mode respect manual adjustments done by the user.

Brightness will always transition to the next schedule starting from the user adjusted brightness.
