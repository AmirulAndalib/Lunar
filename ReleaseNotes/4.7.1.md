# Improvements

* Remove the need for a yellow dot in Gamma and Network control
* Add **Show virtual displays** checkbox in [Advanced settings](lunar://advanced)
    * Turns out DisplayLink monitors show up as virtual and you need this checked if you want Lunar to see the monitor 
* Fix Gamma **(Software Controls*)* curve calculation being skewed in the 0% to 10% range
    * The zero point (no gamma changes) is now when BRIGHTNESS=100 and CONTRAST=75
    * Lightness change between brightness values should be more consistent with the human eye response to light

# Fixes

* Don't check for updates on launch if **Check for updates automatically** is disabled in [Advanced settings](lunar://advanced)
* Fix some unexpected crashes
* Fix license being disabled erroneously on network problems
