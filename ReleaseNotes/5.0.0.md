* Adding **Option** key to the **BlackOut** hotkey will turn off monitor completely through DDC
    * Example: let's say you have configured BlackOut to activate on `Ctrl`-`Command`-`6`
    * Then pressing `Ctrl`-`Command`-`Option`-`6` will allow you to turn off the monitor completely (*just like pressing its physical power button*) if the monitor supports that function
* **Rounded corners** for any display

## Improvements

* Enable the power button in the Lunar window to also work when the **Allow BlackOut on single screen** option is enabled
* Add *high memory usage checker* to aid in fixing memory errors in the future
* Use *Apple Native smooth transitions* using private macOS APIs on Apple vendored displays
* Smooth transitions can now happen in parallel if there are multiple displays with different controls
* Cut the memory usage in half by replacing large images in the UI with vector-drawn bezier paths
* Improved BlackOut logic when using a dummy display
* Filter checkbox for showing/hiding dummy displays
* Hotkeys changing the display with the cursor now affect all monitors in a mirror set
    * This improves support for apps like [BetterDummy](https://github.com/waydabber/BetterDummy)

## Fixes

* Software overlay for Sidecar now appears correctly on first connection
* Notify the system when changing built-in brightness to allow the system curve to readapt
