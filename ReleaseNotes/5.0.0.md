## Features

* Support for **M1 Pro** and **M1 Max**
* **Onboarding** process on first launch
* Redesigned **Diagnostics**
* Redesigned **Quick Actions** menu
    * The menu appears on click instead of hover over the menu bar icon now
    * The native menu can be shown using:
        * Right click (or two finger Trackpad click) on the menu bar icon 
        * Click on the three dots icon in the top right of the Quick Actions menu
* **Sliders everywhere**
    * Merged **brightness and contrast slider**
    * Volume slider in the QuickActions menu
    * *Only possible with the incredible help of [@waydabber](https://github.com/waydabber), maker of [BetterDummy](https://github.com/waydabber/BetterDummy)*
* Redesigned **Display Settings** menus
* **Restart Lunar** menu item and hotkey

* **Overlay/Gamma switcher** button inside the Controls menu
* **App presets** not work for the built-in display as well
* Adding **Option** key to the **BlackOut** hotkey will turn off monitor completely through DDC
    * Example: let's say you have configured BlackOut to activate on `Ctrl`-`Command`-`6`
    * Then pressing `Ctrl`-`Command`-`Option`-`6` will allow you to turn off the monitor completely (*just like pressing its physical power button*) if the monitor supports that function

## Improvements

* Enable the power button in the Lunar window to also work when the **Allow BlackOut on single screen** option is enabled 
* Add *high memory usage checker* to aid in fixing memory errors in the future
* Use *Apple Native smooth transitions* using private macOS APIs on Apple vendored displays
* Smooth transitions can now happen in parallel if there are multiple displays with different controls
* Cut the memory usage in half by replacing large images in the UI with vector-drawn bezier paths
* Improved BlackOut logic when using a dummy display
* Filter checkbox for showing/hiding dummy displays
* Hotkeys changing the display with the cursor now affect all monitors in a mirror set
    * This improves support for apps like [BetterDummy](https://github.com/waydabber/BetterDummy)

## Fixes

* Software overlay for Sidecar now appears correctly on first connection
