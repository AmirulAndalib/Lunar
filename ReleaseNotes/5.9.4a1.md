## Alpha 1

### Improvements

* Add `adaptiveSubzero` display property that allows disabling using  Sub-zero Dimming range automatically in adaptive algorithms
    * There's no UI for it yet, but it can be triggered from the command-line using something like 
        * `lunar displays external adaptiveSubzero off`

### Fixes

* Volume slider was not showing for network controlled monitors
* Lock the panel manager when using resolution/preset Shortcuts
