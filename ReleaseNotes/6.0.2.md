## Features

* `Watchdog`: restart Lunar when it crashes
    * some crashes happen because of causes outside Lunar's control
    * this will ensure Lunar keeps running until the user quits it explicitly
    * when crashing too often, the Watchdog will be disabled automatically
* **[Fix Monitor Arrangement](https://lunar.fyi/shortcuts#fix-monitor-arrangement)** Shortcut to aid in repairing horizontal arrangements that get swapped around by the system

## Improvements

* Better performance and lower CPU usage when the menu is not visible
* Show **"Possibly disconnected"** displays: 
    * these are displays that have **Auto Disconnect** enabled but can't be detected as having the cable connected or not
    * they are always shown until connected to make sure there's always a way to disable Auto Disconnect
