## Fixes

* Fix crash because of gamma smooth transition logic
* Fix crash when Sensor Mode would update brightness on a non-main thread
* Avoid app entering a not responding state when in Location mode and waking the screen

## Improvements

* Make sure Gamma never goes below `0.08` on brightness 0 to retain visibility
* Allow **press-and-hold** detection to be disabled for users that encounter problems with it
* Remove unused serial-port and volume-based sensor options
