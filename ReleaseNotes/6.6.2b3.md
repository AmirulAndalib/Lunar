### beta 3

## Fixes

- Fix a bug that caused the builtin to come out of Blackout intermitently on Intel Macs
- Make sure `lunar toggle-connection` returns immediately after disconnect
- Delay specific actions after wake/login to avoid system hangs. Actions that are delayed include:
    - watching for `screencapture` events when using overlay dimming
    - checking for zero gamma issues
    - adapting brightness if the *Delay after wake* setting is enabled
