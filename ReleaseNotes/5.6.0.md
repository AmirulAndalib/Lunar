## Licensing model

I'm removing the 1-year of updates restriction and will give everyone **unlimited free updates** for **Lunar 5**.

Lunar will move to a major-version upgrade licensing model, where you will only have to pay for a new license if a new major version is launched *(e.g. Lunar 6)*.

If that ever happens, you will also be able to use your previous license as a coupon to get a substantial discount if you previously bought Lunar.

## Features

### XDR Brightness

* Enhance contrast to make the dark-background/bright-text case more usable in the sun
* Make XDR more seamless: **simply increasing the brightness over 100% with your keyboard** should now enable XDR smoothly and without many flickers
* Keep XDR enabled when the screen comes back from standby
* HDR content overblowing is now fixed as long as Gamma is not used
    * *Note: this is still a macOS bug that is awaiting a fix from Apple, all I've done is work around it*

### BlackOut subsystem rewrite

* Now using the same private framework used by `System Preferences`
* More stable mirroring
* Tight integration with the newest version of [BetterDummy](https://github.com/waydabber/BetterDummy/releases/tag/v1.1.10-beta)

### Auto BlackOut OSD

* Allow the system to settle screen configuration
* Allows the user to press `esc` to cancel Auto BlackOut

## Improvements

* Save last resolution before mirroring and re-apply it after mirroring ends
    * This works around a system bug where a non-native resolution is applied when mirroring is disabled
* Lower CPU usage further by reducing UI structure update when menus are not visible
* QuickActions menu becomes scrollable when it reaches the bottom of the screen
* Assign remaining DDC ports sequentially for monitors that can't be matched by `EDID`

## Fixes

* Lower CPU usage by fixing a recursive call on the resolutions dropdown
* Lower memory usage and the number of threads spawned
