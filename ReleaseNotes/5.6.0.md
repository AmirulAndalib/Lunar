    * Allow the system to settle screen configuration
    * Allows the user to press `esc` to cancel Auto BlackOut
* **Menu Density** selector
* **App Info** menu section for showing licence status and version
* **BlackOut rewrite** using the same private framework used by `System Preferences`

## Improvements

* Save last resolution before mirroring and re-apply it after mirroring ends
    * This works around a system bug where a non-native resolution is applied when mirroring is disabled
* Lower CPU usage further by reducing UI structure update when menus are not visible
* QuickActions menu becomes scrollable when it reaches the bottom of the screen

## Fixes

* Lower CPU usage by fixing a recursive call on the resolutions dropdown
