## Improvements

- Add support for MacBook Pro M4 2024

## Known issues

Lunar's Shortcuts actions don't seem to appear on macOS 15.1 for some people. There was no change in Lunar's Shortcuts code that caused this, it's a problem that appeared with a macOS update.

I'm still looking for ways to debug this.
