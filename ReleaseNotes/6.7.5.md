## Features

- **Smoother Sync Mode** brightness adaptation

## Fixes

- Fix printing `SentryCrashExceptionApplication` by mistake in the CLI output
- Fix nits OSD not appearing where it should after resolution change
- Ensure **Full Range** remains enabled even when the system reports an incomplete status

## Improvements

- Add hidden setting `syncModeBrightnessKeyPressedExpireSeconds`

Showing OSD on target monitors in Sync Mode requires only taking into account the changes that happen within a waiting period after the brightness key press.

That period was previously 0.5 seconds, which was now increased to 1 second and made configurable via the `syncModeBrightnessKeyPressedExpireSeconds` hidden setting. Some systems take longer to propagate the brightness change events and this setting should help with that.

- Optimise code path leading from the Sync source brightness change to the Sync target brightness adaptation
- More intuitive nits range calculation in Sync Mode
