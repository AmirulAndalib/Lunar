## Features

### Client-server architecture for the Lunar CLI

The `lunar` command can now control the running Lunar app directly instead of spawning a new instance.

If the Lunar app is not running, the CLI will automatically use the old method of running the command directly.

#### New arguments:

* `--remote` forces the `lunar` command to never spawn a new instance and fail if there's no Lunar app already running
* `--host` configures the hostname where to send the command
    * This means you can now also control Lunar apps running on other Macs
* `--key` configures the API key for authenticating the `lunar` command against the Lunar app server
    * This is only needed when controlling Lunar instances running on other systems
* `--new-instance` forces the `lunar` command to always run the command locally and spawn a new instance even if there's a Lunar app already running

### BlackOut additions

Added **BlackOut without mirroring** on holding `Shift`.
