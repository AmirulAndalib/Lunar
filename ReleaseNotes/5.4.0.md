## Features

### Client-server architecture for the Lunar CLI

The `lunar` command can now control the running Lunar app directly instead of spawning a new instance.

If the Lunar app is not running, the CLI will automatically use the old method of running the command directly.

#### New arguments:

* `--remote` forces the `lunar` command to never spawn a new instance and fail if there's no Lunar app already running
* `--host` configures the hostname where to send the command
    * This means you can now also control Lunar apps running on other Macs
* `--key` configures the API key for authenticating the `lunar` command against the Lunar app server
    * This is only needed when controlling Lunar instances running on other systems
* `--new-instance` forces the `lunar` command to always run the command locally and spawn a new instance even if there's a Lunar app already running

### BlackOut improvements

Added **BlackOut without mirroring** on holding `Shift`.

* Added logic to automatically disable BlackOut when monitors are disconnected and the only remaining display is blacked out
* Configured mirroring as `.appOnly` so that the system doesn't remember the BlackOut mirroring state after Lunar is quit

## Improvements

* Make the resolutions dropdown more useful with some formatting and pretty colors
    * ![resolutions dropdown](https://files.lunar.fyi/resolutions-dropdown.png)
* Add a way to easily toggle between **Software Dimming** and **Hardware DDC**
    * ![toggle software dimming hardware ddc](https://files.lunar.fyi/toggle-software-hardware.png)
* Add a way to install Lunar CLI from the command-line
    * `/Applications/Lunar.app/Contents/MacOS/Lunar install-cli`
* Allow 2-byte values for DDC commands because some monitors support wider ranges (e.g. ASUS PG32U)
