## Features

* **Custom Presets**: save the current brightness/contrast as a preset that you can apply later

* Allow hiding most stuff in the QuickActions menu to get a smaller menu without unneeded functions

* Apply custom presets from the CLI:
    * `lunar preset "Night Owl"`

## Improvements

* The QuickActions menu now grows to the bottom instead of from the center to create a smoother feel
* Make sliders smoother by offloading adaptive mode work from the main thread when changing brightness fast
* Allow hiding **Standard Presets** from the `Options` menu
* Group resolutions by refresh rate
* Add images to differentiate resolutions easier
* Change some text fields to the system monospaced font because I like it
* Lower CPU usage overall by throttling events that happen too fast

## Fixes

* Fix QuickActions menu appearing outside the screen edge
* Fix QuickActions menu redrawing at the center/bottom of the screen when changing specific settings
