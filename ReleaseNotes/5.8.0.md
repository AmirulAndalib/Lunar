## Fixes

* Fix some memory leaks in the DDC AVService matching logic
* Fix volume not respecting the DDC configured range in some cases

## Improvements

* Resume **Adaptive Paused** after toggling from Manual to any other adaptive mode
* Print lux from external light sensor if available when using the `lunar lux` CLI command
* Add exception for VX2453 being detected as projector
* Add **Auto Restart** workaround for when DDC fails on rare setups
    * The option is enabled by default and can be configured from [Advanced settings](https://app.lunar.fyi/advanced)
    * [![auto restart ddc fail](https://files.lunar.fyi/auto-restart-ddc-fail.png)](https://files.lunar.fyi/auto-restart-ddc-fail.png)
* Disable logic for fuzzy matching audio output devices when volume hotkeys are disabled
* Install CLI in the home dir to avoid permission errors
* When brightness transition is set to **Slow**, use faster **Smooth** transitions for manual brightness key adjustments

## Features

* Replace buggy fuzzy-matching logic with the Smith-Waterman algorithm written in Rust from Skim v2
    * This should fix some crashes and make some monitor matching logic faster
* Add ALS support for SparkFun Thing Plus
