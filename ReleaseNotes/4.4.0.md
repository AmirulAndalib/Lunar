## Features

* **DDC support for M1 Macs** (beta)
    * Only possible because of the great advice and example code from [Zhuowei Zhang](https://github.com/zhuowei) and the amazing work of [Davide Guerri](https://github.com/dguerri) and [Tao J](https://github.com/tao-j)

## Improvements

* Add "Hide yellow dot" checkbox in Advanced settings

## Fixes

* Fix license not being activated without an app restart
* Fix Location Mode not fetching correct sunrise/sunset/noon when close to midnight
* Don't reset ColorSync settings and hopefully respect calibration profiles in Gamma mode
* Fix brightness flickering caused by Gamma controls kicking in faster than DDC/CoreDisplay/Network by adding a 5 second delay to the Gamma setter after:
    * App launch
    * System startup
    * Login 
    * Wake from standby
    * Display connection/reconnection
