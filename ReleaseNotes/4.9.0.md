## Improvements

* Re-apply BlackOut on screen wake to account for brightness being set to a non-zero value by the system
    * This needs **Re-apply brightness on screen wake** to be enabled inside [Advanced settings](lunar://advanced)
* Make the Gamma smooth transition dot even less visible to avoid creating the perception of a dust speck on the screen
