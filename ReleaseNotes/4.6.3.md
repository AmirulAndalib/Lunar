## Fixes

* Fix [Auto-learning Curve](https://lunar.fyi/#curve) for **Location** and **Sensor** mode
* Move some UI operations on the main thread to keep the window visually consistent
* Check for possible clamshell mode while Sync Mode is adapting to avoid setting brightness to 0 before the `IsLidClosed` flag has been set
