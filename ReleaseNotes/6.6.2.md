## Features

- Force enable **Night Shift** and **True Tone** on external monitors that support them but don't work out of the box

## Improvements

- Allow **Auto Blackout** to work in more edge cases like:
    - when coming back from standby, the monitor connects too slowly and for a few seconds it appears as there's no display available
    - when opening the lid of the MacBook while clamshell mode is disabled
- Stop brightness and lux CLI listeners when the socket closes

## Fixes

- Fix specific features like observing brightness on the **2023 M2 MacBook Air 15"**
- Fix keyboard backlight being turned on when it shouldn't
- Fix a bug that caused the builtin to come out of Blackout intermitently on Intel Macs
- Disable **Full Range XDR** on Pro Display XDR screens since it is not working there
- Fix **Full Range XDR** and **Gamma Dimming** not being available sometimes after coming back from blackout
- Workaround a macOS bug that can cause *system slow downs* because `CoreLocation` is timing out
- Make sure the DIY light sensor install script gets the correct enclosing dir
- Make sure `lunar toggle-connection` returns immediately after disconnect
- Fix built-in not reconnecting after disconnecting all monitors in specific cases
- Fix **Auto Mode** not selecting **Sensor Mode** when the built-in is disconnected
- Fix **Sync Mode** setting external displays to a very low brightness when activating XDR Brightness
- Delay specific actions after wake/login to avoid system hangs. Actions that are delayed include:
    - watching for `screencapture` events when using overlay dimming
    - checking for zero gamma issues
    - adapting brightness if the *Delay after wake* setting is enabled
