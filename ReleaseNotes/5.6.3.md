## Hotfix

* Fix crash caused by slider hover handler
* Smoother XDR contrast

----

# Changes from v5.6.2

## Licensing model

**Some clarifications are needed after the last change:** 

* I don't have any plans on releasing a major version this year
* If for some reason I have to do that, everyone who paid for the 1-year of free updates before the change will receive the update for free if it's within their update period

## Features

#### XDR Contrast Enhancer slider

Improve readability in direct sunlight when using `XDR Brightness`.

The contrast slider allows adjusting the pixel value formula for the brightest/darkest areas, to get even more contrast out of the miniLED display.

#### New XDR Brightness algorithm

Developed in collaboration with the creator of [BetterDummy](https://github.com/waydabber/BetterDummy), using a more native approach to provide:

* Stable experience when toggling XDR
* Compatibility with higher brightness non-Apple HDR monitors  
* Dynamic EDR pixel values to maximise the nits allowance based on the current brightness

## Improvements

* Show that XDR needs Pro license instead of doing nothing
* Choose alpha upgrades over beta ones when the alpha channel is used
* Move DDC reads outside the main thread
* Improve brightness reponsiveness check
* Collect average DDC read/write time for features that depend on DDC timing (e.g. smooth transitions, refreshing values from monitor memory etc.)
* Better support for scroll up/down to adjust sliders
* Multi-user Fast Switching support
    * Retry display list reconciliation when the system provides invalid IDs
    * Disable Sync Mode if polling seconds is 0 and brightness observer fails to start
    * Observe log in/out events and stop calling screen wake listener if logged out
    * Pause HDR workaround while logged out
    * Pause Lunar if the user switches to another user
* Make brightness text clickable in the menu bar
* Ensure sub-zero dimming works if `Allow zero brightness` is off
* Use less restrictive EDID patterns for finding DDC ports
* Improve DDC compatibility on monitors with missing metadata
* Increase slider reponsiveness


## Fixes

* Fix overall keyboard latency
* Pause some functions when switching users or going to standby
    * Light sensor detection
    * CLI server
    * Color and Gamma reader
    * Brightness observer
* Fix app info not hiding on first launch
* Fix crash on fetching the refresh rate string for the resolution dropdown
