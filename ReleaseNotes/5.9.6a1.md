### Improvements

* Store possibly disconnected displays persistently between restarts
* Limit the disconnect function for Apple Silicon only as it doesn't work reliably on Intel
* Add some failsafe behaviours to make sure we're not left with all screens disconnected
* Improve reliability and efficiency of the lid closed detection mechanism

### Fixes

* Fix **Sync Source** not being remembered when going back and forth through clamshell mode
