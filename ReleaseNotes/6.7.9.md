## Improvements

- Disable volume keys handler on sleep and re-enable on wake to prevent CoreAudio from hanging and cause system lag
- Speed up CLI startup time

## Fixes

- Fix a long-standing issue where **LED Cinema** and **Thunderbolt** displays would overflow the brightness value, causing the display to go dark at specific brightness levels (`39` and `78`)
- Fix Location Mode not being selectable when using manual coordinates
