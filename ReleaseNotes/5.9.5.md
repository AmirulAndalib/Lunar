## Features

#### Support for **M2 Pro/Max**

Both Thunderbolt/DP and HDMI connections on M2 Pro/Max should support DDC in this version.

### Disconnect screens

You'll notice two new actions in macOS Shortcuts: **Disconnect screen** and **Reconnect screen**.

This new method can really disconnect and power off the screen just like closing the MacBook lid or disconnecting a cable would do, freeing up the GPU resources.

You retain the ability to use the MacBook keyboard/trackpad/webcam as usual, and disconnected external monitors *usually* keep the ability to charge the laptop.

These are the effort of reverse engineering the MacBook's clamshell mode which you can read about [in this article](https://alinpanaitiu.com/blog/turn-off-macbook-display-clamshell/)

I'm planning to integrate them into BlackOut eventually but there's a lot more testing I have to do first.

## Improvements

* Make the arrangements/layouts in Shortcuts work when the main display is not the built-in display
* Add **"Set screen as main"** Shortcut
