### Algorithm Variations

#### Fully Automated

This makes Clock Mode override any manual adjustments done by the user.

It also makes it re-apply the brightness of the previous schedule after standby/wake or after a screen reconnection.

#### User Controlled

This makes Clock Mode respect manual adjustments done by the user.

Brightness will always transition to the next schedule starting from the user adjusted brightness.

Also if the system wakes within 30 minutes of a passed schedule, the brightness of that previous schedule is re-applied

### Features

* Add **Send volume to all monitors** setting
    * Helpful for setups with multiple similar monitors, where the audio device can't be matched to the correct monitor

## Improvements

* Remove **Menu** button and allow `Control`+`Click` on the menubar icon to see the menu
    * `Right Click` or `Two Finger Trackpad Click` also works
* Renamed *Options* button to *Settings*
* Renamed *Preferences* button to *Display Settings*
* Fix an annoying macOS bug that keeps resetting the brightness of Apple displays to `50%` after wake
* Remove the `jitterAfterWake` setting since it's no longer needed
* When disconnecting a screen, re-apply previous scaling on remaining screens one by one instead of all at once
