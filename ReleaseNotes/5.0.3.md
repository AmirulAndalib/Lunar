## Features

* Add **Volume Slider** show/hide toggle inside the [DDC menu](lunar://display/ddc) of external displays
* Add **Copy from display** for Curve Factors
* Add possibility to show slider values
* Separate brightness and contrast for app presets when *Merge brightness and contrast* is disabled
* Add **Jitter After Wake** function for monitors that wake up with dimmed brightness
    * Can be activated from the terminal using `defaults write fyi.lunar.Lunar jitterAfterWake 1`

## Improvements

* Make contrast syncing snappier
* Make the CLI DDC values a bit smarter
    * If the value is in the form of `0x1F`, `x1F` or `1Fh` it is parsed as hex
    * Otherwise it is parsed as decimal
    * Passing `--hex` will always parse values as hex
* Work around the system issue where the built-in display brightness is reverting automatically after a manual change

It seems that some MacBooks don't support brightness change event notifications which causes the manual adjustments to not be reflected in the system brightnesss curve.
In this update we try to detect if a MacBook is missing that support and instead of controlling its brightness, we forward the brightness key events to the system and let it do the brightness changing.
Using the sliders for changing the built-in brightness will still have the reverting problem though, because we can't forward those events to the system.


## Fixes

* Don't ask for permissions on every launch if the user doesn't need that functionality
* Don't force focus Lunar window if dark mode is toggled
