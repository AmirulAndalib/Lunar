## Features

* Add **Volume Slider** show/hide toggle inside the [DDC menu](lunar://display/ddc) of external displays
* Add **Copy from display** for Curve Factors

## Improvements

* Make contrast syncing snappier
* Fix built-in display brightness reverting automatically after a manual change

It seems that some MacBooks don't support brightness change event notifications which causes the manual adjustments to not be reflected in the system brightnesss curve.
In this update we try to detect if a MacBook is missing that support and instead of controlling its brightness, we forward the brightness key events to the system and let it do the brightness changing.
Using the sliders for changing the built-in brightness will still have the reverting problem though, because we can't forward those events to the system.
