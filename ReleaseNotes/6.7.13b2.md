## beta 2

## Improvements

- **AppleNativeControl** restricted to built-in displays, Apple displays, and UltraFine displays *(fix for upcoming macOS Sequoia)*
- Ensure Software Dimming does dim the screen instead of whiten it when Invert Colors is enabled in Accessibility settings
    - *This will force a white Overlay instead of Gamma dimming since gamma can't be inverted in a precise enough way*
