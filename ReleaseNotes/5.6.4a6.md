### Improvements

* Disable all Gamma reset calls when disabling the **HDR compatibility workaround**
* Disable **Software Dimming** automatically if DDC/AppleNative works
* Ensure CLI doesn't get stuck on a blocked socket
* Show Screen Blanking dialog even if the zero gamma workaround worked
* More reliable light sensor checker
