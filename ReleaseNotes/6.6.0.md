## Features

### Full Range XDR Brightness

This is a new approach for unlocking the 1600nits of brightness in Apple's XDR displays.

It has the following key differences from the previous XDR Brightness method:

- It doesn't clip colors in HDR content - no more washed out colors
- The system adaptive brightness keeps working and uses the full range
- There's no lag when going from SDR to XDR brightness

Downsides:

- It only works on Apple XDR screens
- The screen will flash one or two times when toggling Full Range

*The system will still adapt the maximum nits of brightness based on the ambient light, so you might get a max of 800 nits in a dark room and 1600 nits in sunlight.*

*Disabling the system adaptive brightness will turn off this behaviour.*

### Preset unlocking

The **Change Screen Preset** Shortcut now allows you to unlock various functions that are locked by macOS when using reference presets.

You can now unlock:

- Brightness Control
- Adaptive Brightness
- Night Shift
- True Tone
