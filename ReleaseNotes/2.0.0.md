## Features

- Sync mode
- The external monitor's brightness/contrast will be kept in sync with the brightness/contrast of the built-in display
- The external monitor's brightness/contrast will still be kept within the configured per-monitor limits
- There are new configurable offsets on the settings page to make the synchronization perfect

## Fixes

- Disable adaptive brightness when no monitor is connected to get to zero energy impact
- Fix interpolation formula
- Disable configurable values when Manual mode is on
