## Features

- New [Layout Setting](https://app.lunar.fyi/layout): **Force System OSD**
  - When enabled, the native macOS OSD will be shown instead of Lunar's custom OSD on displays supporting the *Apple Native* protocol (built-in displays and some external monitors)
  - In macOS 26, this won't apply to external monitors that don't support the Apple Native protocol, as the native OSD doesn't work anymore there
- Allow enabling/disabling DDC, Network, Apple Native, and Gamma control per display from the CLI

Example on enabling DDC and disabling Apple Native in one go:

```bash
lunar displays ultrafine appleNativeEnabled off; lunar displays builtin ddcEnabled on
```
