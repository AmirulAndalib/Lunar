## Features

* Adding **Option** key to the **BlackOut** hotkey will turn off monitor completely through DDC
    * Example: let's say you have configured BlackOut to activate on `Ctrl`-`Command`-`8`
    * Then pressing `Ctrl`-`Command`-`Option`-`8` will allow you to turn off the monitor completely (*just like pressing its physical power button*) if the monitor supports that function

## Improvements

* Enable the power button in the Lunar window to also work when the **Allow BlackOut on single screen** option is enabled
