## Features

* **Onboarding**
* **Restart Lunar** menu item and hotkey

![restart hotkey](https://files.lunar.fyi/restart-hotkey.png)

* **Volume slider**
* **Overlay/Gamma switcher** button inside the Display Settings menu
* Adding **Option** key to the **BlackOut** hotkey will turn off monitor completely through DDC
    * Example: let's say you have configured BlackOut to activate on `Ctrl`-`Command`-`6`
    * Then pressing `Ctrl`-`Command`-`Option`-`6` will allow you to turn off the monitor completely (*just like pressing its physical power button*) if the monitor supports that function

## Improvements

* Enable the power button in the Lunar window to also work when the **Allow BlackOut on single screen** option is enabled 
* Add high memory usage checker to aid in fixing memory errors in the future
* Smooth transitions can now happen in parallel if there are multiple displays with different controls
* Cut the memory usage in half by replacing large images in the UI with vector-drawn bezier paths

## Fixes

* Software overlay for Sidecar now appears correctly on first connection

*And a little easter egg:*
