## Features
* Allow negative offsets for app exceptions
* Add separate curve factors for brightness and contrast

## Improvements

* Add a way to change the automatic check for updates interval in Advanced settings
* Isolate reset actions into a dropdown
* App exceptions logic rewrite
    * Now the offsets are only applied if the app has any visible window on an external monitor (in the past the offsets were applied on app launch/quit)
    * The offsets are also only applied to the monitor where the app is visible

## Fixes

* Always reset adjustment limit within 24 hours
* Fix diagnostics message saying the monitor supports DDC when in fact it didn't support it
