## Fixes

- Fix color adjustments not being applied anymore on some screens
- Don't show nits values by default in the OSD since it can cause it to not appear on some screens
- Revert the max DDC brightness for LED Cinema and Thunderbolt displays back to 100 instead of 255
- Make DCP matching on `IODisplayLocation` optional to avoid DDC not working with some displays
- Fix **Full Range** toggle disappearing sometimes after a display connection
- Fix volume hotkeys not working anymore if CoreAudio times out

## Improvements

- Move the CoreAudio device fetching back to main thread where if it stalls, it will restart the app automatically
- Allow hiding the nits value from the brightness OSD
