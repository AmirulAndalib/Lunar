## Features

* **Efficient Sync Mode**
    * A new internal system API is used to react to built-in display brightness changes instead of polling continuously for them
    * This lowers the CPU usage to `0.1%` on average when no brightness change occurs
    * This new method can be disabled by setting the *Sync Polling Interval* to a value greater than `0 seconds`
    * *If brightness syncing stops working after the update, try setting the Polling Interval to `2 seconds`*

* Add `lunar gamma --restore-color-sync` command for resetting to system default color settings

## Improvements

* Update `ddcutil-server` for Raspberry Pi OS 64-bit
* Improve Lunar CLI help

## Fixes

* Fix software dimming not going back to 100% after app restart on more recent macOS versions
* Fix BlackOut dialog appearing wrongly
