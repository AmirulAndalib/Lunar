## Hotfix

* Fix deadlock caused by the new `delayDDCAfterWake` setting
* Use `HUD` window level for the rounded corners mask window
* Forcefully disable the **Refresh values from monitor settings** option because it makes Lunar hang for too many users
    * This setting is only helpful when brightness is changed outside of Lunar and is not needed in 99% of the cases
    * Most of the monitors don't support DDC reading and Lunar can hang and lag because of waiting too long for a response from the monitor
    * People that actually need the setting can re-enable it from the [Advanced settings](https://app.lunar.fyi/advanced) tab inside the **Options** menu
