# beta 2

## Improvements

- Allow disabling "bad display" detection through the `ignoreDisplaysWithMissingMetadata` setting:

```sh
defaults write fyi.lunar.Lunar ignoreDisplaysWithMissingMetadata false
```

Only to be used in cases where:

- BlackOut wrongly reconnects the screen 5-10 seconds after disconnecting it
- screen remains black after disabling BlackOut

## Fixes

- Adapt software dimming dynamically if **Invert Colors** is used often while Lunar is running *(previously it needed an app restart when changing the Invert Colors setting)*
