## Features
- Quick Actions popover when hovering over the menu item
- Remove all third party analytics and add a single request for counting unique users anonymously
    - This request sends a SHA256 hash of your device serial number to my server through a pubsub service
    - The serial number is impossible to deduce from the hash and the request is untraceable back to your device

## Fixes

- Fix left and right hotkeys not being registered sometimes
- Patch Magnet to disable Input Monitoring request
- Fix preferences saving permission

## Improvements

- Replace Fabric with Sentry for crash reporting because Fabric was acquired by Google
- Remove HotKey library and rely only on the Magnet framework
- Add sane defaults for brightness/contrast limits and offsets
