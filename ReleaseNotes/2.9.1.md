## Features
- Quick Actions popover when hovering over the menu item
- Add support for LG UltraFine displays
- Implement Clamshell Mode
- Keep Lunar in sync by reading the monitor's brightness and contrast periodically
- Remove all third party analytics and add a single request for counting unique users anonymously
    - This request sends a SHA256 hash of your device serial number to my server through a pubsub service
    - The serial number is impossible to deduce from the hash and the request is untraceable back to your device

## Fixes

- Fix left and right hotkeys not being registered sometimes
- Patch Magnet to disable Input Monitoring request
- Fix preferences saving permission
- Fix dictionary access race condition in DDC code

## Improvements

- Replace Fabric with Sentry for crash reporting because Fabric was acquired by Google
- Remove HotKey library and rely only on the Magnet framework
- Add sane defaults for brightness/contrast limits and offsets
- Improve speed and responsiveness by using concurrent tasks where possible
