## Improvements

* Add an IOService event detector to re-create the I2C service port cache when the IOKit tree changes
    * This should help with cases when the monitor is not responding to Lunar's brightness/volume/input changes until app restart

## Fixes

* Fix fetching script dir in Lunar sensor install script
