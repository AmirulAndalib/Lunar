## Fixes

- Use brightness/contrast offsets only in Sync mode

## Features

- Smooth Transition option **<small>[Thanks to Tim Traversy! [@timtraversy](https://github.com/timtraversy) [PR #14](https://github.com/alin23/Lunar/pull/14)]</small>**
    - This makes the brightness/contrast change smoothly from a value to another, instead of jumping directly to that value
    - Check settings page to enable the option
    - I left it off by default because some monitors have a slow response time and smooth transitions end up not being so smooth
- Configurable interpolation factor for Location mode

## Improvements

- Improve charts speed and efficiency with SIMD
- Smoother chart curves
