## v6 beta 6

### Features

* Special **All Displays** slider in Sync Mode to allow syncing brightness without a source display
* **Connect to Sidecar** Shortcut
    * ![sidecar shortcut](https://files.lunar.fyi/sidecar-explanation.webp)
* BlackOut can now natively disconnect/reconnect Sidecar devices
* Add possibility to use the Reset button from the Options menu to:
    * **Reset All Settings** by Option-clicking
    * **Reset display-specific Settings** by Command-clicking
* Unified logging architecture
    * Logs can now be viewed in Console.app or in the terminal with the following command:
        * `log stream --level debug --source --style compact --predicate 'subsystem == "fyi.lunar.Lunar" AND category == "default"'`
    * There is no log file on disk anymore, logs can be collected on demand when they're needed to avoid excessive disk writes

### Improvements

* Stabilize and merge the **BlackOut** and **Disconnect** features
* Increase light sensor timeout to avoid premature disconnections
* Make the auto-learning algorithm almost instantly responsive
* Optimize and minimise the number of math operations on computing the brightness in adaptive modes
* Show what the power off button will do on hover
* Minimise flickering on software dimming setups

### Fixes

* Fixed quite a large number of bugs in old code
* Introduced about the same number of bugs in new code
    * ..that's my idea of *stability*
