## Features

* Beep feedback when pressing volume keys (follows system setting)
    * Hold `Shift` while pressing volume keys to invert behaviour

## Improvements

* Detect when user doesn't want XDR to be auto disabled in low battery situations
* Allow XDR/Subzero/BlackOut OSD to overlap the Dock
    * This avoids overlapping the native brightness OSD

## Fixes

* `Option`+`Shift` now uses 1% step for Subzero and XDR
* Update sensor firmware installer
    * Add support for MagTag and Funhouse boards
* Stop checking for coordinates if location permissions have been denied
