### Lunar is a macOS app for controlling monitors, [with native support for both Intel and Apple Silicon](https://lunar.fyi/#m1) ###

*Note: Lunar changes the actual (physical) brightness and contrast of the monitor.*

*It doesn't use a software overlay.*

## Installation methods ##
- Download PKG from [Official website](https://lunar.fyi)
- Download PKG from the [Releases page](https://github.com/alin23/Lunar/releases)
- `brew install --cask lunar`

## Features ##
- **[Native keyboard control](https://lunar.fyi/#keys)** and hotkeys for setting brightness, volume and contrast that respect the min/max values per monitor
- **[Sensor-based Adaptive Brightness](https://lunar.fyi/#sensor)** (and contrast) based on [an external light sensor](https://lunar.fyi/sensor)
- **[Sync-based Adaptive Brightness](https://lunar.fyi/#sync)** (and contrast) based on the built-in light sensor of the MacBook or iMac
- **[Location-based Adaptive Brightness](https://lunar.fyi/#location)** (and contrast) based on the sunrise/sunset times in your location
- **[App Exception](https://lunar.fyi/#configuration-page)** list if you need more brightness for specific activities (watching movies, design work)
- **[Input switching](#input-hotkeys)** from a convenient dropdown or using up to 3 input-specific hotkeys
- **[Screen orientation](https://lunar.fyi/#display-settings-page)** change from the menu bar or using hotkeys (Ctrl+0/9/8/7 mapped to 0째/90째/180째/270째 for the display with the cursor on it)
- **[Hidden resolutions](https://lunar.fyi/#display-settings-page)** accessible from a dropdown in the [Display Settings menu](#display-settings)
- **[BlackOut](https://lunar.fyi/#blackout)**: turn off monitors (or the built-in display) selectively while also keeping important functions:
    - USB-C charging still works
    - Monitor audio keeps playing
    - Monitor USB hub remains available
    - The built-in keyboard and trackpad are still available for use
    - Avoid overheating the MacBook because of using it with the lid closed

It doesn't interfere at all with the native adaptive brightness that macOS implements for the built-in display.

It works well along Night Shift and True Tone (and f.lux if Gamma/Software controls are not used).

### Contributing ###
I'm pausing contributions for the moment as Lunar has paid features and isn't compilable because of missing parts of the source code *(Pro features code is encrypted)*.

### Building ###
Lunar can't be built from this repo yet as the source code for the paid features is hidden. I will try to post stubs for those paid features to at least make it compilable in an only-free-features form.
