# 2.9.4
## Fixes

- Fix lid closed detection on iMacs and Mac Minis

## Improvements

- Add more crash data to allow me to better diagnose issues remotely
- Make transitions smooth by default on UltraFine displays
- Read brightness periodically by default on UltraFine displays
# 2.9.3
## Fixes

- Fix system freeze caused by trying to read monitor brightness using DDC
- Fix Manual mode values not respecting limits

## Improvements

- Show Quick Actions when changing brightness/contrast using hotkeys
# 2.9.1
## Features
- Quick Actions popover when hovering over the menu item
- Add support for LG UltraFine displays
- Implement Clamshell Mode
- Keep Lunar in sync by reading the monitor's brightness and contrast periodically
- Remove all third party analytics and add a single request for counting unique users anonymously
    - This request sends a SHA256 hash of your device serial number to my server through a pubsub service
    - The serial number is impossible to deduce from the hash and the request is untraceable back to your device

## Fixes

- Fix left and right hotkeys not being registered sometimes
- Patch Magnet to disable Input Monitoring request
- Fix preferences saving permission
- Fix dictionary access race condition in DDC code

## Improvements

- Replace Fabric with Sentry for crash reporting because Fabric was acquired by Google

- Add sane defaults for brightness/contrast limits and offsets
- Improve speed and responsiveness by using concurrent tasks where possible

## Fixes

- Use system generated UUID to store settings per display

## Improvements

- Convert to DDC handling code to Swift
- Store min/max settings as soon as they are changed

# 2.3.3
## Fixes

- Use all EDID data to encode monitor IDs
    - this should allow Lunar to support multiple monitors of the same kind

## Improvements

- Convert to Swift 5

# 2.3.2
## Fixes

- Don't send DDC/CI request for locked value

# 2.3.1
## Fixes

- Check chart entries bounds before updating

## Improvements

- Move to edDSA key for signing updates
# 2.3.0
## Fixes

- Use brightness/contrast offsets only in Sync mode

## Features

- Smooth Transition option **<small>[Thanks to Tim Traversy! [@timtraversy](https://github.com/timtraversy) [PR #14](https://github.com/alin23/Lunar/pull/14)]</small>**
    - This makes the brightness/contrast change smoothly from a value to another, instead of jumping directly to that value
    - Check settings page to enable the option
    - I left it off by default because some monitors have a slow response time and smooth transitions end up not being so smooth
- Configurable interpolation factor for Location mode

## Improvements

- Improve charts speed and efficiency with SIMD
- Smoother chart curves

# 2.2.2
## Fixes

- Don't cap brightness/contrast on manual mode

# 2.0.0
## Features

- Sync mode
- The external monitor's brightness/contrast will be kept in sync with the brightness/contrast of the built-in display
- The external monitor's brightness/contrast will still be kept within the configured per-monitor limits
- There are new configurable offsets on the settings page to make the synchronization perfect

## Fixes

- Disable adaptive brightness when no monitor is connected to get to zero energy impact
- Fix interpolation formula
- Disable configurable values when Manual mode is on

# 1.1.1
## Fixes

- Make sure Adaptive activity isn't scheduled more than once so that percent hotkeys work as expected
- Fix an error that prevented the settings to persist in the database
