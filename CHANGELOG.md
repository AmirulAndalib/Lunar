# 6.7.9
## Improvements

- Disable volume keys handler on sleep and re-enable on wake to prevent CoreAudio from hanging and cause system lag
- Speed up CLI startup time

## Fixes

- Fix a long-standing issue where **LED Cinema** and **Thunderbolt** displays would overflow the brightness value, causing the display to go dark at specific brightness levels (`39` and `78`)
- Fix Location Mode not being selectable when using manual coordinates

# 6.7.8
## Fixes

- Move max DDC brightness back to `255` for Cinema and Thunderbolt displays

# 6.7.7
## Fixes

- Fix nits OSD appearing erroneously when HDR state is being changed

# 6.7.6
## Fixes

- Fix flickering in smooth transitions when holding the brightness keys
- Fix nits value not updating all the time

# 6.7.5
## Features

- **Smoother Sync Mode** brightness adaptation

## Fixes

- Fix printing `SentryCrashExceptionApplication` by mistake in the CLI output
- Fix nits OSD not appearing where it should after resolution change
- Ensure **Full Range** remains enabled even when the system reports an incomplete status

## Improvements

- Add hidden setting `syncModeBrightnessKeyPressedExpireSeconds`

Showing OSD on target monitors in Sync Mode requires only taking into account the changes that happen within a waiting period after the brightness key press.

That period was previously 0.5 seconds, which was now increased to 1 second and made configurable via the `syncModeBrightnessKeyPressedExpireSeconds` hidden setting. Some systems take longer to propagate the brightness change events and this setting should help with that.

- Optimise code path leading from the Sync source brightness change to the Sync target brightness adaptation
- More intuitive nits range calculation in Sync Mode

## Features

### Full Range XDR Brightness

This is a new approach for unlocking the 1600nits of brightness in Apple's XDR displays, developed in collaboration with [@waydabber](https://github.com/waydabber) from [BetterDisplay](https://betterdisplay.pro/).

![full range activation](https://files.lunar.fyi/full-range-activation.gif)

It has the following key differences from the previous XDR Brightness method:

- It doesn't clip colors in HDR content - no more washed out colors
- The system adaptive brightness keeps working and uses the full range
- There's no lag when going from SDR to XDR brightness
- Can be kept on all the time without any downsides
- Can work in tandem with f.lux

Downsides:

- It only works on MacBook Pro XDR screens
- The screen will flash one or two times when toggling Full Range

*The system will still adapt the maximum nits of brightness based on the ambient light, so you might get a max of 800 nits in a dark room and 1600 nits in sunlight.*

*Disabling the system adaptive brightness will turn off this behaviour.*

### Preset unlocking

The **Change Screen Preset** Shortcut now allows you to unlock various functions that are locked by macOS when using reference presets:

- Brightness Control
- Adaptive Brightness
- Night Shift
- True Tone

![unlock preset shortcut](https://files.lunar.fyi/unlock-preset-shortcut.png)

## Improvements

- Allow overlay dimming to work on Airplay screens when the MacBook is in Blackout
- Automatically use the mirroring method for Blackout when the MacBook is connected to an wireless display

## Fixes

- Disable Dark Mode after disabling Night Mode
- Ensure Night Mode does disable after unchecking it
- Fix app hanging when initializing Location Services in some cases
- Fix Dark Mode being disabled erroneously
- Make sure to re-enable keyboard backlight after disabling Blackout
- Fix CLI not working after a few standby cycles
- Fix rounded corners not being applied on app launch

# 6.5.0
## Features

- **Night Mode**: minimize jarring flashes of white regions on dark backgrounds. This is a combination between:
    - *lower whitepoint*: lower the whitepoint of the screen to make white regions appear less bright
    - *warm colors*: filters blue light to further minimise eye strain on bright colors
    - *enhanced contrast*: keeps text readable even at such low brightness levels

The following video shows the difference between simply having Dark Mode on with a low brightness, and having Night Mode on top of that.

If you pay attention to the hand that is scrolling, you'll notice that the flashes of light from the white regions have less effect with Night Mode enabled. In the same way, your eyes will see less of a difference in perceived brightness between the dark background and the bright regions that may appear unexpectedly while scrolling on a web page.

<video src="https://files.lunar.fyi/night-mode-lunar.mp4" controls title="Night Mode vs Dark Mode"></video>

*The technique is quite similar to what f.lux does, but with the added benefit of enhancing contrast for readability.*

**How to activate Night Mode:**

- using the CLI: `lunar night-mode toggle`
- using the *Night Mode* Shortcuts action
- from the Right Click menubar icon menu

* Add **LG specific inputs** for those models where input switching only blinks the monitor but doesn't actually switch the input

![LG specific inputs](https://files.lunar.fyi/lg-specific-input-hotkeys.png)

The new inputs can also be accessed from [macOS Shortcuts](https://lunar.fyi/shortcuts#switch-inputs) or from the CLI using commands like:

```sh
lunar displays lg input lgHdmi1

# Newly added inputs:
#   lgHdmi1 lgHdmi2 lgHdmi3 lgHdmi4
#   lgUsbC1 lgUsbC2 lgUsbC3 lgUsbC4
#   lgDisplayPort1 lgDisplayPort2 lgDisplayPort3 lgDisplayPort4
```

Some LG models respond to the `3` and `4` inputs while others use the `1` and `2` inputs. For example **32UD99** uses `USB-C 3` and `DisplayPort 3` while **32QN650** uses `USB-C 1` and `DisplayPort 1`.

# 6.1.2
## Fixes

* Fix `Overlay Dimming` not working anymore

# 6.1.1
## PWM flicker minimization

By combining hardware and software dimming at specific thresholds, Lunar can help people sensitive to PWM flickering.

*The below video shows how you can use the [Halide](https://halide.cam/) iOS app to find the lowest brightness where flickering starts to appear.*

<video playsinline controls>

#### How to use it

For 2021 Apple Silicon MacBooks, adjust the **Min Brightness** to `38` in [Display Settings](https://app.lunar.fyi/display/builtin) to get advantage of this.

Lunar will then use [Sub-zero Dimming](https://lunar.fyi/#subzero) below that value, which keeps the LED voltage steady while blocking light using the LCD.

![min brightness set to 38](https://files.lunar.fyi/macbook-min-brightness-38.png)

For external monitors and other screens, play with the **Min Brightness** setting until you find the threshold under which PWM flicker becomes noticeable.

Then set the minimum brightness to the lowest value that doesn't cause flicker.

---

## Improvements

* Added `sidecar` option to `lunar toggle-connection` CLI command

## Fixes

* Fix `Sub-zero Dimming` being overridden by the system adaptive brightness
* Fix contrast jumping from max to min when going to/from Sub-zero Dimming

* Added **Sub-zero dimming** range *(can be disabled from the [Controls menu](https://app.lunar.fyi/display/controls))*

![sub-zero dimming in clock mode](https://files.lunar.fyi/clock-mode-subzero.png)

### Algorithm Variations

![fully automated clock mode selector](https://files.lunar.fyi/fully-automated-clock-mode-selector.png)

#### Fully Automated

This makes Clock Mode override any manual adjustments done by the user.

It also makes it re-apply the brightness of the previous schedule after standby/wake or after a screen reconnection.

#### User Controlled

This makes Clock Mode respect manual adjustments done by the user.

Brightness will always transition to the next schedule starting from the user adjusted brightness.

Also if the system wakes within 30 minutes of a passed schedule, the brightness of that previous schedule is re-applied

### Features

* Add **Send volume to all monitors** setting
    * Helpful for setups with multiple similar monitors, where the audio device can't be matched to the correct monitor

*This is a free major version update. Existing Lunar Pro users can keep using their existing license without any action on their part.*

## Sync Mode: new algorithm

### Nits syncing
*(Apple Silicon only)*

Lunar can now read the real brightness value in **nits** from Apple displays and sync it more accurately to other monitors.

Most external monitors don't provide a way to read their min and max nits limits, so they start with a default range of 30-350 nits. Those limits can be adjusted from the Lunar interface:

![image](https://files.lunar.fyi/max-nits-text-field.png)

### Sync without a source

Sync Mode can now be used on all setups, even on those where there's no Apple display to sync from.

An **All Displays** slider will show up which will control the brightness and contrast of all screens in sync. Brightness keys will also control this special slider by default.

Any manual adjustment done to other monitors will be learnt and used by the **All Displays** slider.

<video width=403 height=450 src="https://files.lunar.fyi/sync-all-displays-h264.mp4" autoplay loop muted playsinline disablepictureinpicture></video>


### Optimizations

The adaptive algorithm is now faster and more efficient, with an almost instantly responsive auto-learning curve. This is thanks to using better researched math formulas and new data structures tailored to brightness syncing.

The native brightness OSD will now show up on all monitors instead of only on the source display.

Polling is not used anymore, relying completely on a brightness change event based system, for less battery and CPU usage.

## Sensor Mode: more sensors

### Integrated sensors
*(Apple Silicon only)*

Lunar can now read ambient light lux values from sensors of Apple displays like:

- Studio Display
- Pro Display XDR
- LG UltraFine for Mac
- Thunderbolt Display
- LED Cinema

### Wireless sensors

DIY ambient light sensors will now **connect faster** to Lunar, and keep a more **stable connection** between standby/wake states.

The sensor can also be configured more flexibly using the `defaults` command on the Mac where Lunar is running. This is especially helpful for when the [lunarsensor server](https://github.com/alin23/lunarsensor).

There are three settings that affect where Lunar looks for the sensor:

- `sensorHostname` set by default to `lunarsensor.local`
- `sensorPort` set by default to `80`
- `sensorPathPrefix` set by default to `/`

For example, if you would like to have Lunar listen for sensor events at `homeassistant.local:8123/lunar/events` you would run the following commands:

```sh
defaults write fyi.lunar.Lunar sensorHostname homeassistant.local
defaults write fyi.lunar.Lunar sensorPort 8123
defaults write fyi.lunar.Lunar sensorPathPrefix /lunar
```

### Lux-to-nits curve

Sensor Mode now starts with a better researched and tested curve that converts the ambient light to real nits for each display.

On Apple Silicon, the estimated nits limits from Sync Mode will also be taken into account to compute an accurate brightness value for each display.

## BlackOut

On Apple Silicon devices running macOS Ventura, BlackOut now uses a new API that can **disconnect the screen completely**.

The power button will show the action that it will do based on the modifier keys that are pressed:

<video width=419 height=450 src="https://files.lunar.fyi/blackout-modifiers-h264.mp4" autoplay loop muted playsinline disablepictureinpicture></video>

### Auto Disconnect

When a screen is disconnected, it will appear at the bottom of the Lunar menu, with an option to enable the **Auto Disconnect** feature.

This will ensure the display stays disconnected between standby/wake and lid open/close cycles.

For the **MacBook built-in screen**, this also enables the previous **Auto BlackOut** feature which disconnects the MacBook screen when a monitor is connected, and turns it back on when all monitors are disconnected.

![image](https://files.lunar.fyi/blackout-auto-disconnect.png)

## Sidecar

If you ever wanted to use a keyboard shortcut for connecting a Sidecar device, Lunar now supports that.

There's a new action in Apple Shortcuts that can connect a specific Sidecar iPad, and the `Connection` actions have been updated to support *the most recently used Sidecar*:

![image](https://files.lunar.fyi/sidecar-shortcuts.png)

BlackOut can also natively disconnect/reconnect Sidecar devices on Apple Silicon.

## DDC

Support for brightness/volume control using DDC has been stabilised for the integrated HDMI port of the M1 and M2 chips.

The previous logic was also improved to avoid possible flickering and speed up DDC port matching.

## Other improvements

### Settings
Some settings have been regrouped, and some are now hidden if they aren't relevant to the hardware in use.

It's also possible now to use the **Reset button** from the [Options menu](https://app.lunar.fyi/options) to:

### Logging

Lunar is now using the native unified logging architecture on macOS.

Logs can now be viewed in Console.app or in the terminal with the following command:

```sh
log stream --level debug --source --style compact --predicate 'subsystem == "fyi.lunar.Lunar" AND category == "default"'
```

There is no log file on disk anymore, logs can be collected on demand when they're needed to avoid excessive disk writes.


# 5.9.5
## Features

#### Support for **M2 Pro/Max**

Both Thunderbolt/DP and HDMI connections on M2 Pro/Max should support DDC in this version.

### Disconnect screens

You'll notice two new actions in macOS Shortcuts: **Disconnect screen** and **Reconnect screen**. 

![disconnect screen shortcuts](https://files.lunar.fyi/disconnect-screen-shortcuts.png)

This new method can really disconnect and power off the screen just like closing the MacBook lid or disconnecting a cable would do, freeing up the GPU resources.

You retain the ability to use the MacBook keyboard/trackpad/webcam as usual, and disconnected external monitors *usually* keep the ability to charge the laptop.

These are the effort of reverse engineering the MacBook's clamshell mode which you can read about [in this article](https://alinpanaitiu.com/blog/turn-off-macbook-display-clamshell/)

I'm planning to integrate them into BlackOut eventually but there's a lot more testing I have to do first.

## Improvements

* Make the arrangements/layouts in Shortcuts work when the main display is not the built-in display

## Features

### Client-server architecture for the Lunar CLI

The `lunar` command can now control the running Lunar app directly instead of spawning a new instance.

If the Lunar app is not running, the CLI will automatically use the old method of running the command directly.

#### New arguments:

* `--remote` forces the `lunar` command to never spawn a new instance and fail if there's no Lunar app already running
* `--host` configures the hostname where to send the command
    * This means you can now also control Lunar apps running on other Macs
* `--key` configures the API key for authenticating the `lunar` command against the Lunar app server
    * This is only needed when controlling Lunar instances running on other systems
* `--new-instance` forces the `lunar` command to always run the command locally and spawn a new instance even if there's a Lunar app already running

### BlackOut improvements

Added **BlackOut without mirroring** on holding `Shift`.

![blackout without mirroring tooltip](https://files.lunar.fyi/blackout-without-mirroring-tooltip.png)
![blackout without mirroring menuitem](https://files.lunar.fyi/blackout-without-mirroring-menuitem.png)

* Added logic to automatically disable BlackOut when monitors are disconnected and the only remaining display is blacked out
* Configured mirroring as `.appOnly` so that the system doesn't remember the BlackOut mirroring state after Lunar is quit

## Improvements

* Make the resolutions dropdown more useful with some formatting and pretty colors

* Add **Jitter After Wake** function for monitors that wake up with dimmed brightness
    * Can be activated from the terminal using `defaults write fyi.lunar.Lunar jitterAfterWake 1`

## Improvements

* Make contrast syncing snappier
* Make the CLI DDC values a bit smarter
    * If the value is in the form of `0x1F`, `x1F` or `1Fh` it is parsed as hex
    * Otherwise it is parsed as decimal
    * Passing `--hex` will always parse values as hex
* Work around the system issue where the built-in display brightness is reverting automatically after a manual change

It seems that some MacBooks don't support brightness change event notifications which causes the manual adjustments to not be reflected in the system brightnesss curve.
In this update we try to detect if a MacBook is missing that support and instead of controlling its brightness, we forward the brightness key events to the system and let it do the brightness changing.
Using the sliders for changing the built-in brightness will still have the reverting problem though, because we can't forward those events to the system.

    * Then pressing `Ctrl`-`Command`-`Option`-`6` will allow you to turn off the monitor completely (*just like pressing its physical power button*) if the monitor supports that function
* **Rounded corners** for any display

<video autoplay loop muted width="572" height="450" src="/static/video/screen-corner-radius.mp4" style="width: 572px; height: 450px"/>
