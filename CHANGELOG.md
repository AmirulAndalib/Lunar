# 5.0.3
## Features

* Add **Volume Slider** show/hide toggle inside the [DDC menu](lunar://display/ddc) of external displays
* Add **Copy from display** for Curve Factors
* Add possibility to show slider values
* Separate brightness and contrast for app presets when *Merge brightness and contrast* is disabled
* Add **Jitter After Wake** function for monitors that wake up with dimmed brightness
    * Can be activated from the terminal using `defaults write fyi.lunar.Lunar jitterAfterWake 1`

## Improvements

* Make contrast syncing snappier
* Make the CLI DDC values a bit smarter
    * If the value is in the form of `0x1F`, `x1F` or `1Fh` it is parsed as hex
    * Otherwise it is parsed as decimal
    * Passing `--hex` will always parse values as hex
* Work around the system issue where the built-in display brightness is reverting automatically after a manual change

It seems that some MacBooks don't support brightness change event notifications which causes the manual adjustments to not be reflected in the system brightnesss curve.
In this update we try to detect if a MacBook is missing that support and instead of controlling its brightness, we forward the brightness key events to the system and let it do the brightness changing.
Using the sliders for changing the built-in brightness will still have the reverting problem though, because we can't forward those events to the system.

* Adding **Option** key to the **BlackOut** hotkey will turn off monitor completely through DDC
    * Example: let's say you have configured BlackOut to activate on `Ctrl`-`Command`-`6`
    * Then pressing `Ctrl`-`Command`-`Option`-`6` will allow you to turn off the monitor completely (*just like pressing its physical power button*) if the monitor supports that function
* **Rounded corners** for any display

<video autoplay loop muted width="572" height="450" src="/static/video/screen-corner-radius.mp4" style="width: 572px; height: 450px"/>

        * Press Control + keyboard brightness keys to adjust contrast 
        * Press keyboard volume/mute keys while the audio output is set to the monitor audio device to adjust volume/mute
        * In multi-monitor setups, Lunar can't detect which monitor audio device is selected so it will change the volume of the display that the cursor is on
- Many thanks to Hongfeng Xu (@Mic238) for helping me with extensive testing on these features!


## Improvements

- Detect non-responsive monitors and show that in the Quick Actions popover
- Automatic detection of GPU for adaptive DDC reply delay
    - This should minimize kernel panics and system freezes when reading values from the monitor
- Add special brightness implementation for **LED Cinema** monitors

- Implement Clamshell Mode
- Keep Lunar in sync by reading the monitor's brightness and contrast periodically
- Remove all third party analytics and add a single request for counting unique users anonymously
    - This request sends a SHA256 hash of your device serial number to my server through a pubsub service
    - The serial number is impossible to deduce from the hash and the request is untraceable back to your device

## Fixes

- Fix left and right hotkeys not being registered sometimes
- Patch Magnet to disable Input Monitoring request
- Fix preferences saving permission
- Fix dictionary access race condition in DDC code

- Smooth Transition option **<small>[Thanks to Tim Traversy! [@timtraversy](https://github.com/timtraversy) [PR #14](https://github.com/alin23/Lunar/pull/14)]</small>**
    - This makes the brightness/contrast change smoothly from a value to another, instead of jumping directly to that value
    - Check settings page to enable the option
    - I left it off by default because some monitors have a slow response time and smooth transitions end up not being so smooth
- Configurable interpolation factor for Location mode

- The external monitor's brightness/contrast will still be kept within the configured per-monitor limits
- There are new configurable offsets on the settings page to make the synchronization perfect

## Fixes

- Disable adaptive brightness when no monitor is connected to get to zero energy impact
- Fix interpolation formula
- Disable configurable values when Manual mode is on

# 1.1.1
