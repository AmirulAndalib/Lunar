                                a very low brightness and a very high brightness very close together.
                                (e.g. 5% at 10lux, 100% at 20lux)

                                That would cause constant transitioning between the two learnt brightnesses
                                and very high CPU usage when the ambient light changed continuously.
                                (which happens often when clouds are passing, or when in a moving vehicle)

                                This will disable that safe guard.
